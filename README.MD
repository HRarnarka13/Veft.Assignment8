# VEFT Assignment 8

We were a bit confused of how the users can know their token since we generate it so we just returned the whole user object in the two extra routs we implemented for users. Those two extra routes are:
- `api.post('/users')`
- `api.get('/users/:id')`

We know that it is not good to let anyone get the user token put there was no requirement in the assignment to implement these routes.
